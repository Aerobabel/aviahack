# aviahack

The project is a computer vision model working with the Yolov5 library, an extension of the OpenCv. 
It's open source which means that custom data models can be used knstead of the already existing data set
numpy, matplotlib. A video file was used as the resource but it can also work with live feed. other Aeroplanes are highlighted differently when detected

#Main.py

the models

#physics.py
uses cv2 and an edge detection algorithm which finds traces and maps them to a coordinate system

The yolov5s and yolov5n are different neural network architecture on which the detection algorithms are based.
